# Simply Love (StepMania 5)

This is DDRIllini's fork of Simply Love for SM5, maintained by @andrewipark. We use this theme at the public cabinet at the Illini Union Rec Room.

This theme requires StepMania 5.0.12 or StepMania 5.1 betas.

# Backwards-incompatible changes

* Grades are colored on the results screen to indicate a full combo.

* The opening animation is different.

* Non-English language files are not being actively maintained.

* The bundled judgement font set bundled includes most publicly available options. Please note that these are NOT under the MIT license to the best of our knowledge.
