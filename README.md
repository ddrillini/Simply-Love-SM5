# Simply Love (StepMania 5)

This is DDRIllini's fork of Simply Love for SM5, maintained by @andrewipark. We use this theme at the public cabinet at the Illini Union Rec Room.

# Differences from upstream

* The StomperZ `GameMode` is being used for 'Demonic', a new mode with slightly harsher metrics.

* The opening animation is different.

* The bundled judgement font set bundled includes most publicly available options. Please note that these are NOT under the MIT license to the best of our knowledge.

* Non-English language files may be slightly incorrect due to any of the above changes
